title: SR Linux Troubleshooting Guide
---

This community-oriented practical guide provides the list of common troubleshooting commands and procedures on Nokia 7220/7250 routers running Nokia SR Linux software. It is intended to provide basic troubleshooting steps for the most common issues encountered in the field. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all possible issues, but rather a starting point for troubleshooting.

This Guide is a living document, we will update the chapters with new troubleshooting steps as we go forward and provide containerlab labs to let you practice the steps in a controlled lab environment.

## Structure

The Guide is structured as a collection of chapters, each chapter is dedicated to a specific topic. Each chapter contains a list of common issues and troubleshooting steps to resolve them.

The commands to show state of the applications/components are provided in the form of the CLI commands, as well as the XPATH paths that can be used with gNMI or [JSON-RPC](../programmability/json-rpc/basics.md) management interfaces.
