Learning by doing is not only the most effective method, but also an extremely fun one.

The hands-on tutorials we provide in this section are designed in such a way that anyone can launch them

* at absolutely no cost
* whenever they want it
* whatever machine they have
* and run it for as long as required

The tutorials use [containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev) to deploy the lab environment and so will you. This will ensure that both the tutorial authors and the readers will work on exactly the same environment. No more second guessing why the tutorial's outputs differ from yours!
