SR Linux has lots to offer to various groups of engineers...

Those with a strong networking background will find themselves at home with proven routing stack SR Linux inherited from Nokia SR OS.

Automation engineers will appreciate the vast automation and programmability options thanks to SR Linux NetOps Development Kit and customizable CLI.

Monitoring-obsessed networkers would be pleased with SR Linux 100% YANG coverage and thus through-and-through gNMI-based telemetry support.

**We are happy to chat with you all!** And the chosen venue for our new-forming SR Linux Community is the SR Linux Discord Server which everyone can join!
