## 1.4. Conventions
Nokia SR Linux documentation uses the following command conventions.

* **Bold** type indicates a command that the user must enter.
* Input and output examples are displayed in `Courier` text.
* An open right-angle bracket indicates a progression of menu choices or simple command sequence (often selected from a user interface). Example: **start > connect to**.
* Angle brackets (< >) indicate an item that is not used verbatim. For example, for the command **show ethernet <name>**, name should be replaced with the name of the interface.
* A vertical bar (|) indicates a mutually exclusive argument.
* Square brackets ([ ]) indicate optional elements.
* Braces ({ }) indicate a required choice. When braces are contained within square brackets, they indicate a required choice within an optional element.
* *Italic* type indicates a variable.
* Generic IP addresses are used in examples. Replace these with the appropriate IP addresses used in the system.
